Netharn - A pytorch network harness
-------

NAME:
    netharn (pronounced "net-harn")
FRAMEWORK:
    pytorch
FEATURES: 
    * hyperparameter tracking
    * training directory management
    * callback-based public API 
    * XPU - code abstraction for [cpu, gpu, multi-gpu].
    * single-file deployments (pending public release).
    * reasonable test coverage using pytest and xdoctest
    * CI testing on appveyor and travis (note a few tests are failing due to minor issues)
    * A rich utility set
    * Extensions of pytorch objects (e.g. critions, initializers, layers,
      optimizers, schedulers)
BUILTINS:
   - training loop boilerplate
   - snapshots / checkpoints
   - progress bars (backend_choices: [progiter, tqdm])
   - data provenance of training history in ``train_info.json``
   - tensorboard metric visualization (optional)
DESIGN PHILOSOPHY: 
   Avoid boilerplate, built-it yourself when you need to, and don't repeat yourself.
SLOGAN: 
    Rein and train.
USAGE PATTERNS:
    (1) Write code for a torch object  (i.e. Dataset, Model, Criterion, Initializer, and Scheduler) just as you normally would.
    (2) Inherit from the ``nh.FitHarn`` object, define ``run_batch``, ``on_batch``, ``on_epoch``, etc...
    (3) Create an instance of ``nh.HyperParams`` to specify your dataset, model, criterion, etc...
    (4) Create an instance of your ``FitHarn`` object with those hyperparameters.
    (5) Then execute its ``run`` method.
    (6) ???
    (7) profit
EXAMPLES:
    * ToyData2d classification with nh.models.ToyNet2d (see doctest in netharn/fit_harn.py:__DOC__:0)
    * MNIST digit classification with MnistNet (examples/mnist.py)
    * Cifar10 category classification with ResNet50 / dpn91 (examples/cifar.py)
    * Voc2007+2012 object detection with YOLOv2 (examples/yolo_voc.py)
    * IBEIS metric learning with SiameseLP (examples/siam_ibeis.py)
STABILITY:
   Mostly harmless. Most tests pass, the current failures are probably not
   critical. I'm able to use it on my machine (tm). In this early stage of
   development, there are still a few pain points. Issues and PRs welcome.
KNOWN BUGS:
   * The metrics for computing detection mAP / AP might not be correct.
   * The YOLO example gets to about 70% mAP (using Girshik's mAP code) whereas we should be hitting 74-76%
AUTHORS COMMENTS:
   * My MNIST, CIFAR, and VOC examples will download the data as needed.
   * I'm hoping we can publicly release a few privately developed features.
     They would take a non-trivial amount of developer time to reproduce. These
     features mostly have to do with exporting / deploying fit models.
   * My CIFAR example for ResNet50 achieves 95.72% accuracy, outperforming the
     best DPN92 result (95.16%) that I'm aware of.
     This result seems real, I do not believe I've made an error in measurement
     (but this has need been peer-reviewed so, caveat emptor).  I've reproduced
     this results a few times. You can use the code in examples/cifar.py to see
     if you can too (please tell me if you cannot). 
   * My YOLO example is based of of EAVise's excellent lightnet (https://gitlab.com/EAVISE/lightnet/) package.
   * I reimplemented the CocoAPI (see nh.data.coco_api), because I had some
     (probably minor) issue with the original implementation. I've extended it
     quite a bit, and I'd recommend using it.
   * My metric-learning example requires code that is not publicly available
     :(, so only those with access to a copy of the ibeis software more recent than
     is more
     recent than July 2017
     more recent
     than 2017) can use it without modification.
DEPENDENCIES:
    * torch
    * numpy
    * Cython
    * ubelt
    * xdoctest
    * ... (see requirements.txt)

Installation
============

In the future these instructions may actually be different than the developer
setup instructions, but for now they are the same.

.. code-block:: bash

    mkdir -p ~/code
    git clone git@github.com:Erotemic/netharn.git ~/code/netharn
    cd ~/code/netharn
    ./run_developer_setup.sh

Description
===========

Parameterized fit and prediction harnesses for pytorch.

Trains models and keeps track of your hyperparameters.

This is a clean port of the good parts developed in my research repo: ``clab``. 

See the netharn/examples folder for example usage. The doctests are also a good
resource. It would be nice if we had better docs.

Developer Setup:
================


In the future these instructions might be different from the install
instructions, but for now they are the same.

.. code-block:: bash

    sudo apt-get install python3 python-dev python3-dev \
     build-essential libssl-dev libffi-dev \
     libxml2-dev libxslt1-dev zlib1g-dev \
     python-pip

    mkdir -p ~/code
    git clone git@github.com:Erotemic/netharn.git ~/code/netharn
    cd ~/code/netharn

    ./run_developer_setup.sh


Example:
========

This following example is the doctest in ``netharn/fit_harn.py``. It
demonstrates how to use netharn to train a model to solve a toy problem.  

In this toy problem, we do not extend the nh.FitHarn object, so we are using
the default behavior of ``run_batch``. The default ``on_batch``, and
``on_epoch`` do nothing, so only loss will be the only measurement of
performance.

For further examples please see the examples directory. These example show how
to extend nh.FitHarn to measure performance wrt a particular problem.  The
MNIST and CIFAR examples are the most simple. The YOLO example is more complex.
The IBEIS example depends on non-public data / software, but can still be
useful to look at.  Its complexity is more than CIFAR but less than YOLO.
