netharn
=======

Parameterized fit and prediction harnesses for pytorch.

Traing models and keeps track of your hyperparameters.

This is a clean port of the good parts developed in my research repo: ``clab``. 

See the netharn/examples folder for example usage (currently only ``yolo_voc.py`` is in working order, ``cifar.py`` works but doesnt produce metrics for some reason) The doctests are also a good resource.
