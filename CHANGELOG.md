# Changelog

This changelog follows the specifications detailed in: [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html), although we have not yet reached a `1.0.0` release.


## Version 0.5.3

### Added
* Add `tensorboard_groups` to config
* Add `min_lr` to Monitor
* Add `harn.iter_index`, new property which tracks the number iterations

### Fixed
* Reworked `remove_comments_and_docstrings`, so it always produces valid code.
* `nh.XPU` classmethods now work correctly for inheriting classes
* Iteration indexes are now correct in tensorboard.

### Changed
* `nh.XPU.cast` will now throw deprecation warnings use `nh.XPU.coerce` instead.
* `harn.config` is deprecated using `harn.preferences` instead.
* Progress display now counts epochs starting from 1, so the final epoch will
  read `({harn.epoch + 1})/({harn.monitor.max_epoch})`. The internal `harn.epoch` is still 0-based.
* Made `psutil` dependency optional.
