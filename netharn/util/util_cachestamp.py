class CacheStamp(object):
    """
    Quickly determine if a computation that writes a file has been done.

    DEPRICATE: has been integrated into ubelt

    Writes a file that marks that a procedure has been done by writing a
    "stamp" file to disk. Removing the stamp file will force recomputation.
    However, removing or changing the result of the computation may not trigger
    recomputation unless specific handling is done or the expected "product"
    of the computation is a file and registered with the stamper.  If robust is
    False, we only check if the product exists, and we ignore its hash.

    Args:
        fname (str):
            name of the stamp file

        cfgstr (str):
            configuration associated with the stamped computation.  A common
            pattern is to call `ub.hash_data` on a dependency list.

        dpath (str):
            where to store the cached stamp file

        product (str or list, optional):
            Path or paths that we expect the computation to produce. If
            specified the hash of the paths are stored. It is faster, but lets
            robust if products are not specified.

        robust (bool):
            if True and product was specified, we use the product hash to
            check if it is expired, otherwise we assume the file has not
            been corrupoted or changed.

    Example:
        >>> import ubelt as ub
        >>> from os.path import join
        >>> # Stamp the computation of expensive-to-compute.txt
        >>> dpath = ub.ensure_app_cache_dir('netharn', 'test-cache-stamp')
        >>> product = join(dpath, 'expensive-to-compute.txt')
        >>> self = CacheStamp('somedata', cfgstr='someconfig', dpath=dpath,
        ...                   product=product)
        >>> if self.expired():
        >>>     ub.writeto(product, 'very expensive')
        >>>     self.renew()
        >>> assert not self.expired()
        >>> self.robust = False
        >>> # corrupting the output will not expire in non-robust mode
        >>> ub.writeto(product, 'corrupted')
        >>> assert not self.expired()
        >>> self.robust = True
        >>> # but it will expire if we are not in robust mode
        >>> assert self.expired()
