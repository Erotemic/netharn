class Pretrained(api.Initializer, ub.NiceRepr):
    """
    This class initializes a model with pretrained weights from a file on disk.

    If the model topology is slightly different (e.g. the shape of the final
    layer changes), the weights are partially applied. See
    `netharn.initializers.functional.load_partial_state` for mor details on
    this process.

    Attributes:
        fpath (str | PathLike): location of the pretrained weights file.

            This can be a pytorch '.pt' file containing the model state, a path
            to a netharn deploy '.zip' file.

            While it is best practice to use an explicit filepath, we do allow
            `fpath` be a "fuzzy" glob string as long as the pattern resolves to
            a single file, otherwise an error will be thrown.

        leftover (netharn.Initializer | str): backup initializer if the weights
            can only be partially applied. I.E. The initializer applied to the
            leftover weights that were not in the pretrained file. Can either
            be an initializer class or a coercable initializer string.

        mangle (bool, default=True): If True, mangles tensors that have the
            same key, but different shapes forcing them to fit. This might
            destroy information when forcing a a larger tensor into a smaller
            tensor, or leave extra uninitialized room when a small tensor is
            placed in a larger one. Note be careful when mangling a
            classification layer if class indexes are not aligned.

        association (str): controls how we search for the association between
            the two model states. Can be strict, module-hack, prefix-hack, or
            embedding.

        info (dict, optional): specify explicit history info

        initializer (netharn.Initializer): DEPRECATED use the `leftover`.

        >>> from netharn.initializers.pretrained import *
        >>> from netharn.models import toynet
        >>> from os.path import join
        >>> # Save "pretrained" weights to disk
        >>> model1 = toynet.ToyNet2d()
        >>> dpath = ub.ensure_app_cache_dir('netharn', 'tests')
        >>> fpath = join(dpath, 'toynet_weights.pt')
        >>> torch.save(model1.state_dict(), fpath)
        >>> # Create the initializer and point to the pretrained weights
        >>> self = Pretrained(fpath)
        >>> # Apply the pretrained weights to a new model
        >>> model2 = toynet.ToyNet2d()
        >>> self(model2)
        >>> # xdoctest: +SKIP
        >>> # use experimental ubelt features to hash the model state
        >>> ub.util_hash._HASHABLE_EXTENSIONS._register_torch_extensions()
        >>> ub.util_hash._HASHABLE_EXTENSIONS._register_agressive_extensions()
        >>> hash1 = ub.hash_data(model2.state_dict())
        >>> hash2 = ub.hash_data(model1.state_dict())
        >>> assert hash1 == hash2
